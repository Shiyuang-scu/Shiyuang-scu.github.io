# Chinese Woman Chinese Love

Finally I've finished reading lily's book before the trip to Xuzhou. It's a very interesting experience to meet the author just after reading her book. This book manifests Lily's uneasy and mixing feeling about many things: her past, Ernai problem, Mianzi as well as Guanxi. All of them are tough questions without standard answers. Being a small element of the big society, sometimes we feel helpless as we can hardly change anything.

For those young girls who choose to be kept women, we may know their story and sympathize with their sufferings. But most of the times, we can't even tell what is the right thing to do. Not all mistresses are in it for the money. On the contrary, for love. We know most trouble form our thinking after through the appearance to know the nature. Including human greedy, false, cruel and rude etc. which for fame and gain or being.

I don't think we should blame the girls their lover. I have no reason to advise her not to be the third party. For our society can not provid me some arguments. Deep beneath what we see, there must be something wrong. And what should be mentioned first, is that the two sides of China are incommensurate.

A wife who was dumped for a mistress said, "Mistresses are always lurking in shadows of corruption cases." Corruption is the hidden rule of Chinese government. On one side the officials need to set great examples for most of the people, on the other side they need mistresses to show their differences.

Another problem is Mianzi, if one can not understand mianzi, he will never understand China, though the basis of mianzi seems to be worry about other peoples' opinions. The idea of shame, usually expressed as "mianzi" could be loosely defined as the "status" or "self-respect" in Chinese and by no means alien to foreigners. Many strange phenomenon we see these days in China can find their root on mianzi.

In China, the concept of 'we' seems to be more popular than 'I'. A big country with a huge population leads to small individuals which makes us care more about how other people think of us.

When we know that the power of one person is too little to do anything, guanxi becomes what we are looking for. Parents know that the road to the best universities begins with the best primary schools, and getting your child into one of those takes connections or money. Deep in our mind we believe in that if we have strong guanxi, we can have great privilege. We learn it from our lives and some of them find an easy way to get guanxi, sex.

Now we can see the closed loop from the author's writing. But somehow everyone seems to know what is happening, but don't know how to make a change.
