# 高效学习技巧 | Tips for Highly Effective Learnin

失败其实是件好事。它是最好的学习工具之一——很可能就是最好的。然而大部分学校不但没有好好利用失败，反而竭力把它变成一种难以下咽的东西。学生的成长期几乎都是在学校度过，而在这里，失败是一种罪过。这样一来，等学生毕业的时候，他们会变得极度厌恶失败。

梅根·麦克阿多最近指出：作家们有拖延症是“因为他们在语文课上拿了太多A”。成功的年轻毕业生一直被教导要好好利用自己的才华，这让他们无法从容面对失败。

谷歌寻找的人要具备这样的能力：在他人的想法更好的时候，能退一步，接受他人的观点。“这是一种‘理智上的谦虚’。没有谦虚，人就不能学习，”[谷歌人力资源部长，拉斯洛]波克说道，“成功光环下的人很少经历失败，所以他们不知道如何从失败中学习。” Google looks for the ability to step back and embrace other people’s ideas when they’re better. “It’s ‘intellectual humility.’ Without humility, you are unable to learn,” [Google’s head of people operations, Laszlo] Bock says. “Successful bright people rarely experience failure, and so they don’t learn how to learn from that failure.”

卡罗尔] 德韦克致力于研究失败和人们对于失败的反应。正如你想的一样，大家可不怎么喜欢失败。然而，她通过研究发现，不是所有人面对失败都会极度焦虑。尽管她的许多研究对象讨厌自己做不好的任务，然而有些人在挑战面前反而更优秀。他们享受自己不擅长的事——理由很简单：失败的过程恰恰是学习的过程。 [Carol] Dweck has spent her career studying failure, and how people react to it. As you might expect, failure isn’t all that popular an activity. And yet, as she discovered through her research, not everyone reacts to it by breaking out in hives. While many of the people she studied hated tasks that they didn’t do well, some people thrived under the challenge. They positively relished things they weren’t very good at—for precisely the reason that they should have: when they were failing, they were learning.

1）重复 2）把新旧知识联系起来 1) Repetition 2) Connection of new information to old information

从简单的类比开始，把新旧知识联系起来。建立一个简单的心理模型，然后根据需要把它复杂化，要确保在这个过程中有足够的重复。 Start simple with analogies between the new thing and existing knowledge/skills. Develop a simple mental model, and then expand that mental model until reaching the desired complexity. Ensure there is plenty of repetition along the way.

区分知识、理解、应用这几个概念是很重要的。没错，因为互联网，信息触手可及，但是理解信息并没有变得一样简单。如果不理解，信息就没什么用处。 It's important to differentiate between knowledge and comprehension and application. Yes, information is at our fingertips thanks to the internet, but understanding is not. Information has little value if it is not understood.

教育应该专注于理解和技能应用。然而，人们不能跳过金字塔的任何一级，所以总要花一些时间在学习上，才能到达理解的层面。 Education should focus on the goals of concepts for comprehension and skills application. However, one can't skip levels of the pyramid, so some time must be spent on knowledge in order to reach comprehension.

数据不等于信息，信息不等于知识，知识不等于专业技能，专业技能不等于执行力。 Data is not information. Information is not knowledge. Knowledge is not expertise. Expertise is not execution.

教育的目的在于给你一套工具，你可以靠这套工具搜集周围的数据，理解数据，想办法从中创造出有用的东西。当我们处在信息爆炸的环境中，教育的必要性就增加了。 The purpose of education is to provide you the toolsets that enable you take the data around you, make sense out of it and find out a way to create something productive out of that. As the amount of data around us explode, the necessity for education grows.

所以要拒绝那种挑战到来之前要把所有技能学到手的诱惑。 So avoid the temptation to master all the skills you need before taking on a challenge. 如果有机会，只要水不会比头顶高太多，跳下去再说。 Whenever you can, as long as the water's not too far over your head, just jump in, and figure it out as you go.

时间管理的秘密很简单：绝地武士时间诀窍。 The secret to time management is simple: Jedi time tricks.

高效利用时间的秘诀，就是综合考虑现有情况，在阻止紧急事态蔓延的前提下，把精力投入到最重要的事上。人们总是不由自主地更在意手机消息提醒等需要立即反应的琐事，却将最重要的事情一拖再拖，比如去健身。你要做的是反其道而行，当然这会与大脑的直接反应以及绝大多数人的习惯相冲突。 The secret to mastering your time is to systematically focus on importance and suppress urgency. Humans are pre-wired to focus on things which demand an immediate response, like alerts on their phones – and to postpone things which are most important, like going to the gym. You need to reverse that, which goes against your brain and most of human society.

把最重要的事提前计划好。人类真是一个搞笑的物种。如果要和朋友见面，你会提前和他们约时间。但如果遇到意义重大的事情——比如写本书，或者去健身——你却不会为它制定计划。你只会说“到时候找时间做”。对于那些最重要的事情，请用赶飞机一样的紧迫心态去对待，也就是说要提前给它们留出时间，拒绝任何可能让你误机的事情。 • Schedule your priorities. Humans are such funny critters. If you have a friend to meet, you’ll arrange to see them at a set time. But if you have something that matters to you more than anything – say writing a book, or going to the gym - you won’t schedule it. You’ll just ‘get round to it’. Treat your highest priorities like flights you have to catch: give them a set time in advance and say no to anything that would stop you making your flight.

坐视不管。这是一种简单粗暴，不够专业，然而有时却十分必要的做法。总有些信你抽不出时间回复，总会有些请求你可以允许自己忘记。这样你才有时间慢慢收拾房间，付账单和查看邮箱。无视一些事情，天不会塌下来，你反而能有空去做真正重要的事。 • Ignore. It’s rude, unprofessional and often utterly necessary. There are people you won’t find time to reply to. There are requests you will allow yourself to forget. You can be slow to do things like tidy up, pay bills or open mail. The world won't fall apart. The payoff is you get done what matters.

英雄人物之所以能激励我们，是因为他们能够作出艰难的抉择，他们永不言弃，他们总能做出惊天动地的事情。但我们之所以崇拜英雄还有另一个原因。在内心深处，我们都相信自己有能力成为他们。 Heroes inspire us for many reasons: they make tough decisions, they keep going and they get done what matters. But there’s another reason we love our heroes. Inside us all, we know we have the power to become one ourselves.

创造舒服的环境。如果你饿了，很累或者心情低落，小蛇肯定不会听话。如果你没把自己的状态调整到最佳，他就会哀嚎，尖叫，拒绝做任何你想要干的事。它本来就容易闹情绪，所以你一定要吃好，睡好，留出娱乐的时间。 • Comfort matters. If you're hungry, tired or depressed your baby reptile will rebel. Fail to take care of yourself, and he'll wail and scream and refuse to do a damn thing you say. That's what he's for. Eat, sleep and make time for fun.

强迫自己开始。你能做的最重要的事就是开始。雷克斯的大部分本能是为了避免改变，因此一旦你开始做一件事，这些本能就会变成帮助你进行下去的力量。经过足够长的时间之后，你甚至可以说服雷克斯爱上他曾经讨厌的事。这也是为什么我们强迫孩子们上学或者尝试练琴的原因。 • Force a start. The most important thing you can do is start. Much of Rex's instincts are to avoid change, and once you begin something those instincts start to tip into your favor. With enough time, you can even convince Rex to love doing the things he hated. There's a reason we force kids to go to school or to try piano lessons.

一旦明确了自己的目标，你就能了解自己的思维模式并控制自己的大脑。 Once you know what to look for, you'll start to recognize the patterns and control them.
