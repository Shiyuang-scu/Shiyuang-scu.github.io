## 过往面试题目

+ brain teaser
+ basic set of questions on trees
+ OO design
+ print out a row in a tree
+ Reverse singly-linked list, no extra space, O(n) time
+ recursive function
+ Print all paths to the bottom rightmost entry of a N*N matrix starting from (0,0). There are holes which you cannot walk on. Pretty much the same question in Cracking the Coding Interview.
