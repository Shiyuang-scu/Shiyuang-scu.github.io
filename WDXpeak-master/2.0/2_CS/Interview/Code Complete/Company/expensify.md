> What's the URL of your website? If you don't have one, why not?

Actually I have [one](http://www.wdxtub.com) in Chinese. I'll post my thoughts after reading a book, or some discussion abouts life and study on it. I love reading and writing and have over 100K followers for my blog(though they are all written in Chinese).

> List any published apps that you have.

Three years ago when I had my internship in Microsoft, I developed several Windows Phone apps and one of them was recommended by Nokia in the Windows Marketplace. I also developed several apps on iOS for other companies. Here are the list of them:

1. League of Legends Wiki(WP) [CN](https://www.windowsphone.com/zh-cn/store/app/%E8%8B%B1%E9%9B%84%E8%81%94%E7%9B%9F%E7%99%BE%E7%A7%91/cfd7aaa4-cced-4fb1-9714-77c5e534d1ce), [EN](https://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn/store/apps/league-wiki/9nblggh07vds). The Chinese Version has over 700K downloads with an average 4.5 stars out of 5(Over 17K ratings). It is the assistant tool for players of League of Legends.
2. GoWords(iOS). It is a app for learning words when you run on the running machine so that every seconds count.(As my iOS developer account expired last year this app can not be found in app store)
3. [佳学(iOS)](https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/jia-xue-sheng-huo-ji-nengget/id956706648?l=en&mt=8) This is a online learning platform for different useful life skills. I built the server framework and the iOS client.

I'm also familiar with Android development but Google Play is banned in China so I don't have any published app on Android.

> What's your coding history? When did you start, and what have you done between then and now?

I learned how to code in 18. Starting from C/C++, I made my way through iOS(from iOS3) to Android(from Android 2.1) then Windows Phone(from WP7). For most of the time I have to get everything by myself. So I learn how to design the UI, how to code on different platforms and how to improve the product according to the feedback from users and collected usage statistics.

I got the 2nd place in Imaging Cup 2012(held by Microsoft) and started my internship there for half a year. Different experience helps me to know more about my passion and what I am good at.

> What do you want to do with the rest of your life, and how is Expensify a step toward your long-term goals?

I want to experience more in my life. I thinks working for a great company is a good start after I got my master degree. Expensify is a great company that helps to make people's life better. I'd love to be part of it.

> How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.

I saw this opening on the job hunting platform tartanTRAK from CMU.
