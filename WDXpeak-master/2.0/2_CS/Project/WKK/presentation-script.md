# 展示台词

Good morning, it's my pleasure to give you a brief introduction about my work this semester - `Personal Inforamtion Management base on Knowledge Graph`.

First of all I'd like to say that as the schedule of this presentation changes a lot, I don't have enough time to get everything clean and tidy. But I'll try my best to show you why I choose this project and how do I make it work.

I've made two applications based on Knowledge Graph - Note System just like evernote and Book Recommender system.
