# Construction - Phase 1

Please submit the following:

+ Create a readme file to explain your coding progress highlighting **features/part** of the code completed.
+ As part of coding/construction, if you end up modifying your **design documentation** then please submit the updated docs.
+ Submit your project files showing developed features. It is possible that some features may not be functional as it might be work in progress.

This step acts as a checkpoint for construction and not necessarily a quality check for your code submission.
