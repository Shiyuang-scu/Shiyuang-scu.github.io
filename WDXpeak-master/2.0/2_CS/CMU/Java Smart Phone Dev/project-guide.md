**Description**:

Nowadays, social network Apps are so popular all over the world, some of which are particularly known for almost everyone of us, such as Facebook and Twitter. And two of the important reasons for their popularity are: it satisfies people’s curiosity by conveying interesting information and people can communicate and share things with their friends or even make some new friends. Based on these features, we have the framework of our new App. It is can also be defined as a social App, where people can share their words, pictures and even videos. But we try to achieve more than that. We integrate a Map into our App, so that it will locate the user each time he logs on. So the first function of our map is that some information announced by other users nearby will be presented on the map, which the user can browse the message and comment on them. But he can also search for a position he like to receive more information in that position. The second function is that user can share his words, voice or even video at his location or the location he chose. Additionally, information will be classified into different classes based on the tags the announcers chose, such as ‘Transportation News’, ’Restaurant Introduction’ or ’Videos’. Since all the messages will be more location-oriented, our new App can play more roles in our life.
