## Step 1 Designing Screens

We have create corresponding wireframes to different activities and layouts. Basically it is the same as what described in previous project.

## Step 2 Designing Presentation Tier

We have connected different activities among buttons so that the flow of the app can be done in very basic manner.

See more detail with the class diagram in the doc folder.

## Step 3 Designing Content Provider

As we don't use sql database in the client, we design the shcema for server and the document is in the doc folder.

## Step 4 Designing Application Tier

We have designed the business model in the model package, which covers the basic functions for the app.

## Step 5

Currently we just use google map api in our app, so the code and interface are implemented in the code itself.

## Several notes

+ We have tested the app in different resolutions
+ The models are designed using Object Oriented Design Guidelines
