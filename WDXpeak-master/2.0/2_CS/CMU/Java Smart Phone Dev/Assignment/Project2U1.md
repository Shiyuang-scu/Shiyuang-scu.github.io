# Compiling Project Requirements

## Presenting your initial idea

You should start thinking about what you like to build. Describe in two paragraphs Android Application are you going to build. You can also provide information on what inspired your idea.

Here are high level requirements:

1. Incorporate lessons learned from Unit 1.
2. Build a custom back-end (using Servlets, DB and Web Services) - Usage of turnkey API services does not count - For e.g. Facebook API etc. Although you can use those in conjunction with your custom back-end.
3. Incorporate usage of some (3 to 4) hardware features in your application

You should submit the following in a single document within first week of the first mini

+ Project Name
+ Team Member Names
+ You should have a half a page description of your project.
+ List of Android features you would use for your project and how the feature will be applied

Compiling detailed requirements

1. You are expected to follow these steps for creating detailed requirements:
2. Create a user story (You should consider writing one per actor (user type) for your application).
3. Create a page flow diagram
4. Write use cases
5. Create wireframes and ensure all elements defined in use cases are documented
6. Finally, do a consistency check across all documents.
