# Refine Project Requirements

In this deliverable work on the following two steps to refine your requirements:

1. Bring your wireframes to life. For each screen think about:
    1. Controls (or View/View Groups) that would be user-friendly.
    2. Gestures you might use for each screen.
    3. Sequencing the usage of screens.
    4. Minimal usage of Menus and Dialogs (for user friendliness). Menus should have less frequently used operations.
    5. Main or Alternative steps in use cases should be navigable using controls (views) on the screen (activity) itself.
2. Use the [Business Model Canvas](http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas) for your project and document the value proposition and related elements on framework. Please use the following [example](http://api.ning.com/files/wpDCBwLVdn*4DukzZIAISExep1Go58BOB3peIySMhJMHYX*xSKBuSB4WYkwAitcmkinLGKElSYnFw-3JitDNrOmqlzyo1Hqa/TorontoZoo.jpg) for reference. Pl. do not spend more than 45 mins on this exercise.
