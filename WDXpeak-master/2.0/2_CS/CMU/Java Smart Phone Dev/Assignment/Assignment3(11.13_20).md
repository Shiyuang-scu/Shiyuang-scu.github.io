# Assignment 3

```
Android App - Part a:
Write an Android Application to keep records and perform statistical analysis for a class of students. The class may have up to 40 students. There are five quizzes during the term. Each student is identified by a four-digit student ID number.

The program is to print the student scores and calculate and print the statistics for each quiz. The output is in the same order as the input; no sorting is needed. The output from the program should be similar to the following:

Here is some sample data - not to be used as sample for calculations:
Stud         Q1         Q2         Q3         Q4         Q5
1234         78         83         87         91         86
2134         67         77         84         82         79
1852         77         89         93         87         71

High Score     78     89     93     91     86
Low Score      67     77     84     82     71
Average        73.4   83.0   88.2   86.6   78.6

This application must by done using SQL Lite DB on Android Device.

Android App - part b:
Create an (proof of concept) application that can be used for marketing  a vocal artist. You can hard code the data for an artist. Your implementation should use assets placed locally on a device (This means that the apk file will include all assets and should not exceed 10 to 20 mb in size).

Activities:
1. Main Page showing vocal artist's image(s) and contact information (including name, link to official website, contact #, Email address), Likes, Dislikes, Date of Birth, Links to Social Networks
2. Songs - Two to Three Audio files.
3. Videos - Two to Three mp4 (or other popular video media)
4. Wallpaper - Set of vocal artists images
5. Get on my mailing list:  A simple form that sends an email to vocal artists for adding a potential audience member on mailing list.
