The System Design interview will be done with more senior member of Google, typically they have a lot of interviews under their belt. You can expect to design a software system. It will start with a high level concept (ex: design twitter), and then based on your responses they’ll dive deeper into the problem (usually a deep dive into 2-3 areas). This is really focused on performance, maintenance, and scalability, so chat about those and be prepared to defend your design! Also expect wrenches to be thrown into your design, for example changes in requirements or something new. They’re looking to see how you respond in these situations. You should be driving this discussion, but redirect if engineer asks you to do so. At least some knowledge of distributed systems will be required for this, so read up on those and prepare with that in mind. When you’re preparing and during the interview really think about the scale at which Google does stuff, it’s okay to say, “I’ve never worked at that scale, but in my experience _____.” You do have some level of control in this interview, so start with your space of expertise and go from there!
