## Course Overview

Software Architecture and Design (SA&D) is a one-semester course, aiming to train our graduate students from software engineers toward becoming a Software Architect, who is the “Technical Lead” of a software project team. 

The primary objective of the course is to help students develop skills in designing, developing, and justifying reasonable software architecture for enterprise-scale software-intensive systems, considering both functional and non-functional requirements as well as contextual system environments. 

Core topics include: overview of software architecture, micro-architectural patterns (design patterns) and macro-architectural patterns (modern patterns), service oriented architecture, architectural modeling, viewpoints and perspectives, architectural analysis techniques, architectural tactics (QoS), agile architecture, and some advanced topics. 

Literature survey and study of state-of-the-art technologies, as well as both individual and group project work, are essential ingredients of this class. Research and practical projects build upon one another.

Software architecture has become increasingly important in the last two decades in the software engineering community. At the heart of every well-engineered software system is always its software architecture. Software architecture deals with the high-level building blocks that represent an underlying software system. These building blocks are the components (units of computation in a system), the connectors (models of the interactions between software components), and the configurations (arrangements of software components and connectors, and the rules that guide their composition). Software architectures that have been proved to be useful for families of systems are often codified into architectural styles (patterns).

This course will afford the students a complete treatment of software architecture, its foundation, principles, and elements, including those described above. The class will include reading assignments, and homeworks that will test comprehension and understanding of the course materials. 

A class project will require the student to leverage the architectural techniques learned during the course (e.g., architectural recovery, architectural styles, domain specific software architectures) to, coupled with programming/implementation effort, design and implement a real-world software system. Students will also learn how to present and justify architectural proposals and decisions. In addition to foundations, and practical experience with software architectures, the class will also introduce the student to the state-of-the-art in software architecture research, future trends and state-of-the-practice.

Students are expected to attend class regularly, and participate (as directed) in all class discussions, and most importantly, have fun! 

## Course Core Points

+ Architecture Description and Architectural Views
+ Micro Architectural Patterns (usually known as Design Patterns)
+ Macro Architectural Patterns (modern models such as SOA)
+ Quality Attributes (NFA)
+ Architectural Tradeoffs 

As a result of completing the Architecture and Design course, students will be able to:

+ Clearly define architectural problems in terms of quality attributes, scenarios, trade-offs, stakeholders and concerns;
+ Understand important architectural patterns (e.g., Multi-tier Model, Service Oriented Architecture) along with their advantages and disadvantages;
+ Identify architectural tactics relevant to specific architectural problems;
+ Design architectural models leveraging existing architectural patterns;
+ Distinguish different architectural views and decide how to use them to effectively describe an architecture;
+ Evaluate architectures in terms of their risks and tradeoffs, and how well they address quality attribute requirements and how well they address stakeholder concerns; 

## About the Instructor 

Dr. Jia Zhang is an Associate Teaching Professor in the area of Software Engineering at Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Her recent research interests center on service oriented computing (software engineering in large), with a focus on collaborative scientific workflows, Internet of Things, and big data management. She has co-authored one textbook titled "Services Computing" and has published over 150 refereed journal papers, book chapters, and conference papers. She is now an Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on Services Computing (TSC) and of International Journal of Web Services Research (JWSR), and Editor-in-Chief of International Journal of Services Computing (IJSC). Zhang also has nine years of software architect experience in industry.

## Reading Materials

For each week, there will be reading assignments from books, technical papers and/or presentation files.  You are expected to complete all assigned readings for the week prior to consequent lecture time. I may randomly ask students questions at the beginning of each lecture - your performance will contribute to the overall evaluation portion in your final grade. The technical papers are available either directly on the Internet (mostly from course website) or via the CMU Library. Please learn how to access papers (e.g., ACM and IEEE) via the CMU Library through VPN connection. We reserve the right to give in-class.

## Grading

Grading Component	Weight (%)

+ Individual homework and programming project 35
+ Midterm exam	15
+ Final exam	20
+ Team Project (github code base, technical report, presentations, tutorial) 27
+ Overall evaluation	3
+ TOTAL 100  

The correspondence between points earned (%) and letter grades is mapped out in the following table:

+ 94 - 100 A
+ 90 - 93 A-
+ 87 - 89 B+
+ 83 - 86 B
+ 80 - 82 B-

+ 60 - 69 D
+ <60 F

## Exams

The course will include one final exam (in the university's official final examination period) and one midterm exam (in the 8th week in class). Students must take the midterm exam and final exam at the scheduled date, time, and place. No make-up exam will be permitted except for emergent medical situation supported by doctor's formal documents.
