## 4 Independence Assumption

### 4.1

Conditional on D, list all variables that are independent of G.

D is not a collider node.

Variables: $A,B,C,E,F,H,I$

### 4.2

List all variables that are independent of A

Variables: $B,D,G$

### 4.3

Conditional on D, list all variables that are independent of I

Variables: $B,G$

### 4.4 

Conditional on E, F, G, find variables whose joint probability is independent of D

Variables: $H,I$

### 4.5 

Conditional on D, find variables whose joint probability is independent of E, F, G

Variables: $empty$

### 4.6 

Conditional on E, find variables whose joint probability is independent of H

Variables: $A,B,C,D,F,G,I$
