# 医保事宜

If you have received a letter from your student health provide (Aetna), you can ignore it according to http://www.cmu.edu/health-services/student-insurance/Aetna%20SSN%20Letter.html.
 
If you haven't received your Aetna member ID card, please email shinsure@andrew.cmu.edu and ask for your ID card number. Once you have the ID card number, you should be able to register at www.aetna.com.
 
You will be able to find all the network doctors, specialist, hospitals and urgent care centers under your student insurance plan once you have created your Aetna account.
 
In general, I suggest you visit CMU Health Services (http://www.cmu.edu/health-services/) for all your health related issue if it is open.
 
By the way, the Health Services has added the links http://www.cmu.edu/health-services/emergencies/index.html and http://www.cmu.edu/health-services/emergencies/local_hospitals.html to its website regarding the emergency contacts.
 
Regards,

This is one of the requirements of the
