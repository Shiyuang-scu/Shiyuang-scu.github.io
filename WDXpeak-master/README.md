WDXpeak Note
===========

I'm planning to migrate all my note to github. I can not stand the evernote anymore -> huge, slow, ugly. I want an elegant way to note my life.

Evernote is a great tool to collect and connect to the word. But not a good tool to build links within. So It's time to change!

不要导入，整理并思考，完整的复制没有意义，有目的收集才是正道

Here is how I arrange my personal notebook

+ Body: building strong body
+ Computer Science: well I have to learn something to make my life
+ Daily: what a mess
+ English: how can I survive in USA
+ Imagine: jumping into the future
+ Interest: love something, do that thing
+ Kindle: clippings from kindle
+ Life: different aspects of my life
+ List: books, packages, fit, etc, all about list
+ Mind: limitation never exists
+ Novel: time for fun
+ Project: working on them
+ Science: my religion
+ Work: do something, love that thing
+ World: just want to know more
