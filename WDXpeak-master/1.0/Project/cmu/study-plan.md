# Study Plan

## Research Area of Interest and Major

I'll study Electrical and Computer Engineering(ECE) in Carnegie Mellon University(CMU) for my Professional M.S. degree. Now I'm a student in JIE(SYSU-CMU Joint Institute of Engineering) which is founded by Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU) and Carnegie Mellon University.

According to the requirements of the program, I should finish at least 6 courses(60 units) in the next two semesters in Pittsburgh. I'm interested in natural language processing, so here are the courses I want to choose in the next semester:

+ 15513   Introduction to Computer System
+ 18697   Statistical Discovery and Learning
+ 95771   Data Structures and Algorithms

## Is your program coursework only?

Yes. My study in Carnegie Mellon University will be course-based.

## Advisor & Department Head

My study in CMU will be course-based which means there will be no advisor for research. Still we have a course advisor named Jimmy Zhu(jzhu@ece.cmu.edu)

## Why do I choose the JIE double-degree program?

Engineering is the most important ability in current world. The JIE program founded by SYSU and CMU suits my interests very well. Carnegie Mellon University is famous for its engineering education, especially natural language processing. It is a great chance for me to learn more about it and improve my abilities in engineering. This is why I choose this program.

## Career Objective

Most technology for natural language processing are based on English. But I want to apply them on Chinese. Also, my grandparents used to raise me when I was a child but as the time goes by, there may not be much time left for them. After finishing my master degree in America, I want to come back to China and help Chinese software/internet company solve difficult problems on processing Chinese language and take good care of my grandparents. That's my current carrer goal.
