#Becoming Steve Jobs: The Evolution of a Reckless Upstart Into a Visionary Leader

Xerox’s famed Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), where Steve first saw a computer with a mouse and a graphical “bitmapped” screen interface, resides here. This was where he had chosen to headquarter NeXT.

He explained that when he ran out of tea one day, it dawned on him that he liked plain old hot water, too. “It’s soothing in the very same way,” he said.

---

higher education needed better computers, and only NeXT could deliver them. The company was working closely with both Stanford and Carnegie Mellon—universities with highly respected computer science departments. “They’ll be our first customers.”

---

The intensity of his self-confidence made me hang on his every word. He spoke in carefully constructed sentences, even when trying to answer an unexpected question.

---

Later, I came to realize that this was because Steve wanted whatever was written about him and his work to measure up to his own high standard of quality.

---

And yet I now knew Steve well enough to understand that he and Perot, whom I’d interviewed a few times, were actually kindred spirits: both were idiosyncratic, idealistic autodidacts.

---

Throughout his life, Steve had a keen sense of the tactical value of press coverage; this was just one part of what Regis McKenna, perhaps his most important early mentor, calls “Steve’s natural gift for marketing. Even when he was twenty-two years old he had the intuition,” McKenna elaborated. “He understood what was great about Sony, about Intel. He wanted that kind of image for what he was going to create.”

---

Steve always did love to tell people how to conduct their personal lives.

---

THE MOST BASIC question about Steve’s career is this: How could the man who had been such an inconsistent, inconsiderate, rash, and wrongheaded businessman that he was exiled from the company he founded become the venerated CEO who revived Apple and created a whole new set of culture-defining products that transformed the company into the most valuable and admired enterprise on earth and that changed the everyday lives of billions of people from all different socioeconomic strata and cultures?

---

While he was an introspective guy, he was not inclined to retrospection: “What’s the point in looking back,” he told me in one email. “I’d rather look forward to all the good things to come.”

---

The failures, stinging reversals, miscommunications, bad judgment calls, emphases on wrong values—the whole Pandora’s box of immaturity—were necessary prerequisites to the clarity, moderation, reflection, and steadiness he would display in later years.

---

Driven and curious even when things were tough, he was a learning machine during these years, and he took to heart all that he gleaned.

---

No one works in a vacuum. Getting married and beginning a family changed Steve profoundly, in ways that had an enormous positive impact on his work.

---

What I have always loved about business journalism, and what I have learned from the very best colleagues I’ve worked with, is that there is always a human side to the seemingly calculated world of industry.

---

But only in writing this book have I come to understand just how much the personal life and the business life of Steve Jobs overlapped, and just how much the one informed the other. You can’t really understand how Steve became our generation’s Edison and Ford and Disney and Elvis, all rolled into one, until you understand this. It’s what makes his reinvention such a great tale.

---

As I exited he didn’t even say goodbye. He just stood there, looking out the glass doors toward the entrance of the parking lot on Deer Creek Road where a crew of workmen was installing a 3-D version of the NeXT logo.

---

He knew in his bones, as he would say, that he was about to do something great. In reality, of course,

---

He knew in his bones, as he would say, that he was about to do something great. In reality, of course, he had no idea what was ahead of him.

---

The car, in fact, was a model for what he thought computers should be: powerful, sleek, intuitive, and efficient, nothing wasted at all.

---

Having a grand, bold goal was useless if you didn’t have the ability to tell a compelling story about how you’d get there. That seemed obvious.

---

You should have the best. Don’t settle for second best.”

---

Steve didn’t care about their accomplishments. He was always comfortable in a fight. Challenges, confrontations: in his limited experience, this was how you got things done; this was how the great stuff broke through.

---

While away from Apple, Steve Jobs had started to learn how to make the most of his strengths, and how to temper somewhat his perilous weaknesses.

---

Steve is a great object lesson in someone who masterfully improved his ability to make better use of his strengths and to effectively mitigate those aspects of his personality that got in the way of those strengths. His negative qualities didn’t go away, nor were they replaced by new good traits. But he learned how to manage himself, his own personal miasma of talents and rough edges.

---

For precocious kids like Steve, the implicit promise in all this was that anything could be figured out—and since anything could be figured out, anything could be built. “It gave one the sense that one could build the things that one saw around oneself in the universe,” he once told me. “These things were not mysteries anymore.

---

Steve innately understood from an early age that the right words and stories could help him win the attention he needed to get what he wanted.
