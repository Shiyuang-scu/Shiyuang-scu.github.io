#挑战你认知的心理学发现 | The most awesome psychological facts

We fall in love with someone because of how they make us feel about ourselves. Love is selfish like that. It's why we keep going back to those who once used to make us feel good in our skin, in our bodies and our faces. When someone makes us feel funny, smart, attractive, talented, desirable we innately fall in love with them. This is true of friendship as well. 我们之所以会爱上别人，是因为他们让我们自我感觉良好。爱就是那么自私。这就是为什么我们依然会回忆起那些曾经让我们对自身的肌肤、身材、脸庞感觉良好的人。当某人使我们感觉自己有趣、聪明、漂亮、有才、性感，我们会自然地坠入爱河。友谊也是如此。

That's love. So, if you're ever wondering why your relationship with your partner isn't where it should be: remember that when people feel good about themselves, they'll likely reciprocate it. Don't run to the gym and get in shape (okay . . . do that, but don't do just that). Don't buy flowers. Make your partner feel beautiful, valuable, virile, strong, sexy, attractive, wanted, important, intelligent, etc. (Actions always speak louder than words) Make that person feel like they did when you first fell in love. 那就是爱。所以，如果你之前一直想知道为什么和伴侣的关系不太和谐：记住，当一份感情让人们自我感觉良好时，他们才可能做点什么作为回报。跑去健身房保持体形没什么用（好吧……就这么做也行，但别只这么做）。也不要买花。而是让你的伴侣感觉自己美丽动人、强壮刚健、性感迷人、令人钦佩、不可或缺、无可取代、聪慧过人等等。（行胜于言）让对方一直觉得处于初恋时的状态。

The strongest way to endear yourself to someone is to express a need for their help and to make them feel needed. The greatest way to build a friendship is to accept what a person can give and demand that they give it (within reason). This is complicated because this little bit of heuristics seems like it should be well known and well understood. But we get it wrong so often. 想让某人爱你，最有效的方式是请求他们的帮助，并让他们感到自己是被需要的。想建立友谊，最好的方式是接受别人的给予，并不断要求对方有所付出（在合理的范围内）。这很复杂，因为这点小小的启发看起来众所周知也很好理解，但我们常常用错了地方。

So to recap: · Make a person fall in love with themselves and they'll fall in love with you. · Take what a person offers, at least occasionally, to tell them they have value. · Allow a person to contribute within their skills and abilities to let them know they are needed and a part of your family. · Ask a person for help to reaffirm their self-worth and to endear yourself to them.

我们来总结一下： · 如果你让一个人爱上他们自己，他们就会爱上你。 · 你应当至少偶尔接受别人的付出，然后告诉别人，他们的付出很有价值。 · 让别人贡献他们的技能和能力，让他们知道自己被需要，知道自己是你家庭的一份子。 · 向别人寻求帮助，以此来再次肯定他们的自我价值，你也会获得他们的喜爱。

If you want someone to say yes to something you're asking for, here are some options: 1. Nod as you ask. Our brains have what are called 'mirror neurons' which activate to make us mimic other people's actions. Sometimes they will also start to nod, which then makes them then agree with you. 2. If you have a big favor to ask, start by asking smaller ones ahead of time. This is called the foot in the door phenomenon, I believe. If you ask for small things, then work up to big things, people are more likely to say yes than if you start off with a huge favor. 3. Inversely, if you are asking for a small favor but still know that they will probably say no, start by asking them for a huge favor. Then when they say no, ask for the smaller one. They're more likely to say yes, especially if they feel a bit bad about turning down the first request.

想要别人答应你的请求，不妨试试下面几种方法： 1. 在提出请求的同时点头。我们大脑里有一种“镜像神经”，会让我们不由自主地模仿他人的动作。因此有时候对方也会跟着点头，然后就只得答应你了。 2. 想要别人答应一个较大的请求，可以先提出一个较小的请求。我想这就是所谓的“得寸进尺法”。如果你先提小请求，再过渡到较大的请求，相比一开始就提出大请求，会更容易得到对方的同意。 3. 相反，如果你希望别人答应你一个较小的请求，而且你心里清楚对方很可能会拒绝，那就不妨先提出一个较大的请求。当对方拒绝时，再提出原本这个较小的请求。这样对方会更容易答应，尤其是当对方因为拒绝了你第一个请求而感到愧疚时。

在体育上的应用：可以迫使他人质疑自己的能力。例如，我在打一场球赛，对方有一个球员打得很好，我只要给他一个简单的评价：你怎么突然投篮投得这么准了？短短一句话就能产生巨大的心理效应，因为通常对方不知道该如何反应，就会怀疑是不是自己表现不正常。过不了多久，对方就会发挥失常。

The belief that people are constantly scrutinizing your behavior and the resultant paranoia and self-doubt that arises from it is called the spotlight effect. 认为周围的人在不断地审视着你的行为以及由此引发的恐慌和自卑的心理被称为“焦点效应”。
