#那些“过来人”教我的事 | What Those Who've "Been There, Done That" Taught Us

You are going to be amazed at how brief life is. Don't waste any of it. 你将会惊讶于人生是如此短暂。不要浪费它的一丝一毫。

---

Patience, circumspection, understatement, modesty, honesty, kindness, thrift, charity...earn the respect of those whose opinion is worth having, including yourself. 忍耐、谨慎、低调、谦逊、诚实、善良、节俭、慈悲……赢得那些能给出有价值的意见的人的尊重，包括你自己。

---

Never be cynical about love. Cherish those to whom you are close—parents, siblings, children, other friends and neighbours. When/if you find a partner for life make your commitment to that person absolute, unconditional and eternal. If a lifetime commitment is not for you then, at the very least, don't make other people unhappy by reason of your interactions with them. 永远用全部身心去爱。珍惜你所亲近的人 – 父母、兄弟姐妹、子女、其他朋友与邻居。若找到人生伴侣，给他/她纯粹的、无条件的和永恒的承诺。。如果终生承诺并不适合你，那么最起码，不要由于你与其他人的交往而使他们不开心。

---

Eschew the pursuit of material possessions. Excess is waste. Aim for an elegant sufficiency. Being rich is no guarantee of happiness. 避免追求物质财富。过度就是浪费。寻求一种优雅高尚的充足。富有并不能保证幸福。

---

Fashion, in all things, is vapid, transient and contemptible. 在一切事物中，时尚是无趣、短暂和可鄙的。

---

Do your best to avoid ill health and premature death—never smoke, little alcohol, be continuously physically active at some things you enjoy, adhere to an austere diet to stay permanently slim. 尽你所能避免疾病与早逝——永不吸烟，少饮酒，在你所喜欢的事情上不断积极进取，坚持严苛饮食以永远保持苗条。

---

Never stop learning. From kindergarten to senescence there should always be something that engages your interest. 永远不要停止学习。从幼儿园开始到年华老去，总会有一些事会引发你的兴趣。

---

Be open to the possibility of a spiritual dimension to your life—doesn't matter what it’s called, if it has a name. You are more than a self-propelled, self-aware bag of chemicals. You are a sentient creature. 乐意接受你生命中精神维度上的诸多可能——不必考虑它的称谓，如果它非得有一个名字的话。你不只是自力推进并能自我感知的化学物质包。你是有感情的生物体。

---

Be socially active — engage with those around you. Develop a communitarian worldview. 积极开展社交 — 与你周围的人建立友好关系。发展社群主义世界观。

---

Great Together (Marriage) - Never go to bed angry. 最和谐的相处（婚姻）– 永远不要带着怒气上床。

---

1. Marry Someone a Lot like You - similarity in core values; homogamy - homogamous marriages; "finding someone who is similar in upbringing, general orientation, and values is the single most important component of a long and satisfying marriage". 2. Friendship Is as Important as Romantic Love - "the experts suggest you consider what you would like in a lifelong friend and look for that in a potential spouse". 3. Don't Keep Score - both parties give 100% all the time. Not 50% in and 50% out. "When you wake up in the morning, think, “What can I do to make her day just a little happier”. 4. Talk to Each Other - learn to communicate about conflicts. We all need to learn how to fight. 5. Don't Just Commit to Your Partner--Commit to Marriage Itself - Make a commitment to the idea of marriage and take it seriously.

There is nothing wrong admitting there is something you don't know or something you don't know how to do. Facing these small deficiencies will teach you new information and new skills. There is nothing really bad about being wrong. If you get something wrong there is likely to be someone and then you will know the right stuff. 承认你不知道或你不知道如何去做无可厚非。这些小小的缺憾将教你新信息与新技能。做错了根本没有什么糟糕的。如果你对某些事情有所误解，可能会有人指出你的错误，你将会知道正确的内容。

---

If you don't know that the other person is 'the one,' he or she is not. And though it sucks to be alone -- believe me, I know: I was alone for years -- it's better than settling. Don't settle. You'll still be alone. It is very possible to be alone while being in a relationship. Many people are. 如果你不知道对方就是“对的那个人”，那么他/她就不是。尽管孤独令人郁闷——相信我，我了解那种感觉：我一个人过了很多年——但是单身好过将就。别将就。你还是会孤单。就算处在一段恋爱关系中，你也有可能感到孤独。很多人都如此。

---

2. There's no such thing as a "grown up," and if you try to be one, you'll wind up becoming a poser at best and a killjoy at worst. 2. 没有“成熟的人”这一说。如果你想成为一个成熟的人，你最终好的结果将是成为一个装模作样的人，而坏的结果则是一个大煞风景的人。

---

3. Most grownups stop learning. Don't. 多数成人停止了学习。不要这样。

---

4. If you're an artist or "creative person," stop trying to "be original." 如果你是一位艺术家，或者“有创造力的人”，不要努力“成为原创”。

---

5. If you focus on what's fair and what's unfair, you'll stagnate. 如果你一心计较的是公平，那么你不会有进步。

---

6. If you're not failing, you're doing it wrong. 如果你从来没有失败过，那你一定做错

---

7. You can't reason with a lizard. 你没法和蜥蜴讲道理(对牛弹琴)

---

If someone is hysterical or angry, it's pointless to reason with him. Don't try. The "lizard brain" can't use logic. Understand that you're dealing with a cornered animal, not a calm philosopher. 如果一个人很生气或者歇斯底里的， 和他讲道理是没有意义的。 别试了， 就蜥蜴那脑子，没法讲道理的。记着， 你面对的是一头困兽，而不是一个冷静的哲学家。

---

Do something that's not for money. 做一些不牟利的事请。

---

The hour before bed is for you. 睡前的时间是你自己的

---

There is no such thing as highbrow and lowbrow. 没有什么高级趣味和低级趣味的说法

---

For it is true that differences exist and that a great deal may be said about them....In the distress of comparison the troubled person may go at last so far that in view of the difference he forgets that he is a man, so that in despair he conceives himself so different from other men that he even conceives he is different from what is meant by being a man, just as the lily was to inconspicuous that it was questionable if it was really a lily.

---

差异确实存在，关于差异的讨论也数不胜数……一个人陷于相互比较的悲苦中，又想到这些差异，最后可能会忘了他是一个人；于是在绝望中，他认为自己和别人如此不同，不同到甚至认为自己没有活出当一个人的意义，就像那朵百合去怀疑自己是否真的是一朵百合一样。

---

I realize that much of what I thought was very important was actually pretty trivial. 我意识到，很多我曾经认为举足轻重的事情，其实微不足道。

---

The things that were important seemed less so at the time. So much of my energy went into work, but almost none of my fondest memories have to do with work. 那些所谓重要的事情，随着时间的推移变得渐渐不重要了。过去，我全身心地投入工作中，然而我最难忘的记忆却和我的工作毫无关联

---

Rather, my best memories are things like the kindness that someone showed me, or the kindness that I had the opportunity to show. 让我记忆深刻的那些瞬间来自他人给我带来的友好，或者是那些我能够体现关怀和体贴的时刻。

---

Finally, I understand my own relative insignificance in the grand scheme of things. That understanding is very liberating. 最后，我想说的是，一个人其实在很多时候在某种大环境里是无足轻重的。领悟了这一点，一切都会轻松很多。
